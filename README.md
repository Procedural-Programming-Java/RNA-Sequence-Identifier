# RNA-Sequence-Identifier

 * Ribonucleic acid, or RNA is one of the three major
 * biological macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life
 * (along with DNA and proteins). A central tenet of molecular biology states
 * that the flow of genetic information in a cell is from DNA through RNA to
 * proteins: “DNA makes RNA makes protein”. Proteins are the workhorses of the
 * cell; they play leading roles in the cell as enzymes, as structural
 * components, and in cell signaling, to name just a few. DNA(deoxyribonucleic
 * acid) is considered the “blueprint” of the cell; it carries all of the
 * genetic information required for the cell to grow, to take in nutrients, and
 * to propagate. RNA–in this role–is the “DNA photocopy” of the cell. When the
 * cell needs to produce a certain protein, it activates the protein’s gene–the
 * portion of DNA that codes for that protein–and produces multiple copies of
 * that piece of DNA in the form of messenger RNA, or mRNA. The multiple copies
 * of mRNA are then used to translate the genetic code into protein through the
 * action of the cell’s protein manufacturing machinery, the ribosomes. Thus,
 * RNA expands the quantity of a given protein that can be made at one time from
 * one given gene, and it provides an important control point for regulating
 * when and how much protein gets made. Therefore, we are Writing a program that
 * would indicate the codon within the RNA strip and returning the amino acid.
 * This was a challenging program but, it help me improve on String manipulation
 * and a better understanding of a new way on how to write different methods.
